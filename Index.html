    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <div class="text-block1">
        <p>First of all I must to say that I have no IT experience at all. My current occupation lies in completely different area and I have to start from the very beginnings. Every single tool which a task requires me to work with, such as VSCode or GitHub, is totally new to me as far as I never had a need to work with it before.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, I like to learn languages. Despite our native language is completely natural thing to us, any language is a code that allows us to understand each other or to gain whatever we may need. From this particular point of view, general principles of JS, HTML, Python or other programming language are quite similar to any national language, having its rules, syntaxes, common phrases etc.</p>
    
        <p>Besides the possibility to add some founds to my budget, I would like to try to find myself in IT area in order to spend my free time to learn something new in order to go beyond my comfort zone just like Iâ€™d try to learn any other language.</p>
